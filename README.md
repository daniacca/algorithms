# Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of various algorithms developed in Go.
The main purpose is to share and acquire knowledge and skills in the language, using small programming exercises and implementations of fundamental computer science data structures and algorithms (such as sorting) as the primary means.

## Project Structure

- `go/`: Main directory containing the Go source code.

## Implemented Algorithms

Below is a list of the algorithms currently available in the repository:

- **Selection Sort**: A sorting algorithm that uses the divide and conquer paradigm.
- **Merge Sort**: A sorting algorithm that uses the divide and conquer paradigm.

## Requirements

To compile and run the algorithms in this repository, you need to have installed:

- **Go**: Version 1.16 or later. You can download it from the official site: [https://golang.org/dl/](https://golang.org/dl/)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/daniacca/algorithms.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd algorithms/go
   ```
3. **Run the desired algorithm**:
   ```bash
   go run algorithm_name.go
   ```
   Replace `algorithm_name.go` with the name of the file you want to execute.
